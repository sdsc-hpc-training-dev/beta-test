## Expanse Overview:

### HPC for the *long tail* of science:
* Designed by Dell and SDSC delivering 5.16 peak petaflops
* Designed and operated on the principle that the majority of computational research is performed at modest scale: large number jobs that run for less than 48 hours, but can be computationally intensvie and generate large amounts of data.
* An NSF-funded system available through the eXtreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) program (https://www.xsede.org).
* Supports interactive computing and science gateways.
* Will offer Composible Systems and Cloud Bursting.

* 8 Core Complex Dies (CCDs).
* CCDs connect to memory, I/O, and each other through the I/O Die.
* 8 memory channels per socket.
* DDR4 memory at 3200MHz.
* PCI Gen4, up to 128 lanes of high speed I/O.
* Memory and I/O can be abstracted into separate quadrants each with 2 DIMM channels and 32 I/O lanes.
* 2 Core Complexes (CCXs) per CCD
* 4 Zen2 cores in each CCX share a16ML3 cache. Total of 16x16=256MB L3 cache.
* Each core includes a private 512KB L2 cache.

### New Expanse Feature: Composable Systems

<img src="https://github.com/sdsc-hpc-training-org/expanse-101/blob/main/images/expanse_composable_systems.png" alt="Expanse Composable Systems" width="400px" />
Composable Systems will support complex, distributed, workflows â€“ making Expanse part of a larger CI ecosystem.

* Bright Cluster Manager + Kubernetes
* Core components developed via NSF- funded CHASE-CI (NSF Award # 1730158), and the Pacific Research Platform (NSF Award # 1541349)
* Requests for a composable system will be part of an XRAC request
* Advanced User Support resources available to assist with projects - this is part of our operations funding.
  *  Webinar scheduled for April 2021. See: https://www.sdsc.edu/education_and_training/training_hpc.html


### New Expanse Feature: Cloud Bursting
Expanse will support integration with public clouds:

* Supports projects that share data, need access to novel technologies, and integrate cloud resources into workflows
* Slurm + in-house developed software + Terraform (Hashicorp)
* Early work funded internally and via NSF E-CAS/Internet2 project for CIPRES (Exploring Cloud for the Acceleration of Science, Award #1904444).
* Approach is cloud-agnostic and will support the major cloud providers.
* Users submit directly via Slurm, or as part of a composed system.
* Options for data movement: data in the cloud; remote mounting of file systems; cached filesystems (e.g., StashCache), and data transfer during the job.
* Funding for users cloud resources is not part of an Expanse award: the researcher must have access to cloud computing credits via other NSF awards and funding.
