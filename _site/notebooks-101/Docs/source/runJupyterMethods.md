# Jupyter Services on Comet

Overview of this section
You can access a jupyter notebook directly from your browser after starting it on the login node. This method is insecure, and will result in a notebook served over http, which is not something you want to be using on a regular basis.

## Access the node in your browser
Copy the the URL above into the browser running on your laptop.

### Use your jupyterlab/jupyter notebook server!
Enjoy. Note that your notebook is unsecured.
